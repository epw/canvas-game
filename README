This library is set up to help make HTML5 games with the <canvas> tag.

To use, copy canvas-game.js and a version of jquery (jquery-1.5.min.js
is included with the distribution) to the directory on your webserver
where you will be writing the game.

Assuming that the primary game page is in the same directory as the
two .js files, include these lines in between the <head> and </head>
tags of the HTML page:
     <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.5.min.js"></script>
     <script type="text/javascript" src="canvas-game.js"></script>

Any version of jquery should work, so if one is already available,
then it can be used instead.

game.js contains an example of how to use the library.
